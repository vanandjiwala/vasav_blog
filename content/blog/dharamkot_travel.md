## Dharamkot

Dharamkot holds a special place in my heart. My first ever hostel experience is from Dharamkot so of course I'll be a little biased. 27th June 2021 was the date when I reached Dharamkot zostel. Initially I was a bit sceptical about staying at hostels. Since I had covid twice, I was a bit paranoid about staying at hostels or tourist places. On arrival, I saw a completely different world in itself. People were staying there for months and having a time of their life in dharamkot. Dharamkot is also like any other destination but people make such a place beautiful. I was fortunate enough to come across a wonderful bunch of people at Dharamkot. My initial stay at Dharamkot was a couple of weeks but I never felt like leaving the place. 

Dharamkot has a lot to offer in terms of activities. Among most places in Himachal, this place is one of the most happening places. You will find almost everything here, especially around summer and monsoon months. This place is a paradise for the artists. You will come across good musicians, singers, illustrators, photographers, yoga instructors and what not. Such place can provide a great source of inspiration for creative people. In this article, I am going to provide more information around Dharamkot, activities to do and places to have good food.

## Places of interest 

There are 3 major regions of interest near Dharamkot.[ McLeodGanj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeodGanj), dharamkot and Bhagsu. Every place has its own charm. McLeodGanj and Bhagsu are a bit more touristy places while dharamkot attracts different crowds. The major activity in this region is the Triund trek, which is one of the most popular treks in the Himachal. Most people visit Dharamkot as it comes on the way to Triund. There's a popular Bhagsu waterfall which is also another starting point for the triund trek. There are tons of cafes in this area and now with more and more people coming in for work, most of them are equipped with internet connection. Naddi is another place which attracts a number of tourists.

## Treks/Hikes

* Triund (1 Day)
* Snowline (2 Day)
* Mana valley (2 Day)
* Moon peak (4 Day)
* Lahesh caves (3 Day)
* Kareri lake (2 Days)
* Gallu waterfall (1 Day)

I have listed most of the treks which I am aware about. They start either from upper dharamkot or McLeodGanj. There are many tour operators who arrange these treks and camping. Triund and snowline are the most popular and moderate level treks. **Try to avoid these treks on weekends or long weekends**. People have gone to the top for camping and did not get a camp despite payment/bookings. So if possible try to visit triund/snowline over the weekdays. Triund is a fairly straightforward trek so technically you don't need a guide.

## Accomodation

There are plenty of options for accommodation as well. There are hostels and homestays in this area. If you are planning to stay longer then homestays will be a better option. Most hostels have cafes, so you can still connect with people if you are staying at a home stay. Here are the list of hostels I know:

* Zostel
* Mitra
* Young Monk
* Alt life
* Shalom
* Fruglers
* Bunker

I have stayed at Zostel only. Zostel has awesome hosts and the people staying there were also amazing. Most essential things can be easily obtained from a 200 meter radius. Plus this is the best place to stay if you are planning to go to Triund.

## Cafes/Food

When it comes to food, I found Dharamkot the best. There are many options here and there for food. Here's the list of cafes I have visited in Dharamkot.

* The salvation cafe
* Rain's kitchen
* Birdhouse cakery (Pizzas available only on Saturday)
* Frugler's cafe
* Altlife cafe
* Buddha delight cafe (Must visit)
* Trek and dine
* Morgan's cafe
* Jungle calling
* Sunset cafe (Popular spot for sunsets + Maggi + Tea)
* One cup coffee
* Mowgli (Opening on 11th November)



## Conclusion

Most people extend their stay at this location. If you want to experience a good hostel experience then you must visit Dharamkot. Places like Dharamshala and Bir can also be explored while staying at Dharamkot.
