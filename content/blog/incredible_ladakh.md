## Ladakh 2018
I visited Ladakh in June 2018 for wildlife photography. I started my trip from Leh and then visited places like Pangong tso, Hanle and Tso kar. It was one hell of a trip in which we spent most of the time in the field. We were able to capture birds and mammals of ladakh. This post will be a quick photo series. I will include more details if possible in future.
