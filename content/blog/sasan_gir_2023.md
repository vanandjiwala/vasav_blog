## Introduction
Sasan Gir, a mesmerizing destination nestled in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, India, is renowned for its thriving population of the majestic Asiatic lions. Having journeyed to this captivating wilderness in the last week of October, I was greeted by an awe-inspiring landscape brimming with diverse flora and fauna. With its rugged terrain and rich biodiversity, Sasan Gir beckons to all wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers alike, offering a unique opportunity to witness the grace and power of these magnificent big cats in their natural habitat.

During my recent escapade, I found myself captivated by the sheer beauty and tranquility that envelops this sanctuary, fostering a deep appreciation for the delicate balance of life within this intricate ecosystem. Venturing into the heart of the Gir forest, I embarked on a quest to capture the essence of this enchanting realm, immersing myself in the vibrant sights and sounds that define this extraordinary wildlife sanctuary. Join me as I recount my unforgettable adventures amidst the captivating wilderness of Sasan Gir.

## Reaching Sansan Gir
There are multiple ways to reach Sasan gir, here are the list of few of them:

1. Drive from Ahmedabad (Approx 375 KMs) - Depending on the traffic and road condition, it can take upto 6.5 to 8 hours to reach there by car. 
2. Get a train to either Junagadh or Somnath. Both Junagadh and Somnath are in close proximity to Sasan, So you can easily get a cab or a shared ride from the station
3. Fly to Rajkot airport and then take a cab (Approx 180 Kms). This can also take upto 4-5 hours. 

## Accomodation
There are many options to stay at Sasan gir. Important factor to consider is to have it closer to `sinh sadan` which is a central permit booking office and you have to be there in order to board safari vehicles. I stayed at the Gir Jungle Lodge which has all the basics requirements and good vegetarian food options.
