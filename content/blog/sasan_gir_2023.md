## Introduction
Sasan Gir, a mesmerizing destination nestled in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, India, is renowned for its thriving population of the majestic Asiatic lions. Having journeyed to this captivating wilderness in the last week of October, I was greeted by an awe-inspiring landscape brimming with diverse flora and fauna. With its rugged terrain and rich biodiversity, Sasan Gir beckons to all wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers alike, offering a unique opportunity to witness the grace and power of these magnificent big cats in their natural habitat.

During my recent escapade, I found myself captivated by the sheer beauty and tranquility that envelops this sanctuary, fostering a deep appreciation for the delicate balance of life within this intricate ecosystem. Venturing into the heart of the Gir forest, I embarked on a quest to capture the essence of this enchanting realm, immersing myself in the vibrant sights and sounds that define this extraordinary wildlife sanctuary. Join me as I recount my unforgettable adventures amidst the captivating wilderness of Sasan Gir.

## Reaching Sansan Gir
There are multiple ways to reach Sasan gir, here are the list of few of them:

1. Drive from Ahmedabad (Approx 375 KMs) - Depending on the traffic and road condition, it can take upto 6.5 to 8 hours to reach there by car. 
2. Get a train to either Junagadh or Somnath. Both Junagadh and Somnath are in close proximity to Sasan, So you can easily get a cab or a shared ride from the station
3. Fly to Rajkot airport and then take a cab (Approx 180 Kms). This can also take upto 4-5 hours. 

## Accomodation
There are many options to stay at Sasan gir. Important factor to consider is to have it closer to `sinh sadan` which is a central permit booking office and you have to be there in order to board safari vehicles. I stayed at the Gir Jungle Lodge which has all the basics requirements and good vegetarian food options.

## Sightings

Exploring wildlife parks for the perfect shot is both thrilling and rewarding. To enhance your wildlife photography experience, consider these tips:

- Extended Safari Sessions for Maximum Impact:
Most wildlife parks are vast, with only a fraction open to tourists. To boost your chances of capturing that perfect shot, dedicate ample time to the jungle. I personally recommend undertaking 4-6 safaris at a location. For closer destinations, a 1-day trip with 2 safaris can be a game-changer.

- Get Acquainted with the Territory:
Familiarize yourself with the park to understand the best locations for wildlife encounters. Spend time observing the patterns and habits of the animals, increasing your chances of being in the right place at the right time.

- Adapt to Varying Animal Densities:
Different national parks boast varying densities of wildlife. Embrace the unpredictability and diversity each park offers. Go in with an open mind, sans expectations, and relish the journey in the wild.

- Trust Your Guides and Drivers:
Wildlife guides and drivers are seasoned experts. Trust their knowledge and expertise; they'll go the extra mile to help you spot elusive creatures. Forge a good rapport with them to enhance your overall experience.

- Allocate Ample Time:
Due to the unpredictable nature of animals, patience is key. Allocate enough time to avoid returning empty-handed. Plan your schedule with flexibility, giving yourself the best chance to witness the wonders of the wild.

- Prepare for the Unexpected:
While animal sightings are a matter of luck, meticulous research can significantly increase your odds. Stay informed about the park's ecosystem, prevalent species, and recent sightings. Hope for the best, but be ready to adapt to unexpected moments.

## Photography
Capturing the magic of wildlife in photographs is an art, and my approach revolves around simplicity and creativity. I always begin with a record shot to capture the essence of the scene, focusing on the animal or bird as a starting point. Once I've secured a few good record shots, I unleash my creativity by experimenting with settings.

In wildlife photography, time is of the essence, and there's often a small window of opportunity. Missing a key moment, whether it's a bird's head turn, a lion's yawn, or a critical action sequence like mating, means no second chances. Start with a safe option and then gradually explore various compositions and creative shots.

During safaris, limiting the number of people can provide the freedom to move around the vehicle. While everyone strives for a low angle, the experience can be a bit chaotic. As photographers, we must be patient and maintain composure after spotting wildlife. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement, forgetting camera settings and ending up with less-than-ideal photos. Staying alert and observant is crucial, as multiple events may unfold simultaneously. Don't just click; pay attention to the naturalist and other instructions in the safari vehicle.

My shooting technique is a blend of old-school simplicity and effective control. I prefer aperture priority with manual ISO settings, adjusting ISO based on lighting conditions to control shutter speed. Typically, I set my f-stop to the lowest number, depending on the lens and focal length. For group shots of birds or animals, I keep the aperture wide open.

While my technique is somewhat traditional, I'm open to experimentation. One approach I'm keen to try is shooting in Manual mode, focusing solely on controlling shutter speed. This involves locking the f-stop to the minimum number and setting auto ISO. While I'm a bit skeptical due to DSLRs' limitations in ISO performance, mirrorless users have found success with this technique, capitalizing on better dynamic range and improved ISO performance.

Remember, wildlife photography is an ever-evolving journey. Stay curious, be patient, and embrace the unpredictability of the wild.
