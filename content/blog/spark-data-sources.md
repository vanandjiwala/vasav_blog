## Spark data sources
Spark support various data sources. Spark has some core data sources built into it while the others are available and maintained by other developers from the community. In this post, I am going to explain the **core** data sources supported by pyspark.

Here is the list of **core** data sources supported by spark. 
1. CSV
2. json
3. parquet
4. ORC
5. JDBC/ODBC Connection
6. Plain text files

## Data sources API

### Reading Data

Foundation of reading data in apache spark is ```DataFrameReader``` which is an [interface](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrameReader.html) to load a dataframe from an external data source. We can access it throgh ```read``` attribute of spark sessoion. 

```
spark.read
```

Once we have dataframe reader, we can specify several values based on the type of data source.

1. format
2. schema
3. read mode
4. series of options

All these options returns ```DataFrameReader```. 

format, schema and options are self explanatory. Examples will give a better idea about them. read mode is an important thing and you must understand it so you can use an appropriate mode while creating a dataframe. 
 
 #### Read Modes

 Reading from an external data source can have malformed data. Read mode specifies that what spark should do when it encounters malformed data. There are 3 read modes. 

 1. permissive -> **Default**
 2. failFast
 3. dropMalFormed

### Writing Data
Writing operation is very similar to the reading operation. Here we have to use ```DataFrameWriter``` instead of ```DataFrameReader```. For writing since we have to write a dataframe, the ```DataFrameWriter``` can be accessed on a dataframe. 

```
df.write
```
Once we have dataframe writer, we can specify several values based on the type of data source.

1. format
2. path
3. save mode
4. series of options


Here we have a set of concepts which are important to know while writing a file based data source. I will cover these topics in future as these may need a dedicated post. 

1. partition by
2. bucket by
3. sort by

Similar to read mode, we have write modes when we want to write data. Here we have 4 write mode. 

1. append
2. overwrite
3. ignore
4. errorIfExists -> **default**

## Data sources quick summary

### CSV
csv is a commonly used data format. It is a comma separated file in which every line represent a new record. CSVs are tricky file format as it encounters a lot of issues in the production system due to the assumptions made. In order to make it flexible, csv file format provides a lot of options which I am listing below from the official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-csv.html).

It supports the following case-insensitive modes. Note that Spark tries to parse only required columns in CSV under column pruning. Therefore, corrupt records can be different based on required set of fields. This behavior can be controlled by spark.sql.csv.parser.columnPruning.enabled (enabled by default). PERMISSIVE: when it meets a corrupted record, puts the malformed string into a field configured by columnNameOfCorruptRecord, and sets malformed fields to null. To keep corrupt records, an user can set a string type field named columnNameOfCorruptRecord in an user-defined schema. If a schema does not have the field, it drops corrupt records during parsing. A record with less/more tokens than schema is not a corrupted record to CSV. When it meets a record having fewer tokens than the length of the schema, sets null to extra fields. When the record has more tokens than the length of the schema, it drops extra tokens. DROPMALFORMED: ignores the whole corrupted records. This mode is unsupported in the CSV built-in functions. FAILFAST: throws an exception when it meets corrupted records. | read       |
| columnNameOfCorruptRecord | (value of spark.sql.columnNameOfCorruptRecord configuration) | Allows renaming the new field having malformed string created by PERMISSIVE mode.

STOP_AT_CLOSING_QUOTE: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, accumulate the quote character and proceed parsing the value as a quoted value, until a closing quote is found. BACK_TO_DELIMITER: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, consider the value as an unquoted value. This will make the parser accumulate all characters of the current parsed value until the delimiter is found. If no delimiter is found in the value, the parser will continue accumulating characters from the input until a delimiter or line ending is found. STOP_AT_DELIMITER: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, consider the value as an unquoted value. This will make the parser accumulate all characters until the delimiter or a line ending is found in the input. SKIP_VALUE: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, the content parsed for the given value will be skipped and the value set in nullValue will be produced instead. RAISE_ERROR: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, a TextParsingException will be thrown.                                                                                | read       |

### Json
Json file format is stable as it allows you to append to a file with new records. Since Json have structure, spark can make assumptions. Since Json file have structre, we have less number of options associated with this format.

PERMISSIVE: when it meets a corrupted record, puts the malformed string into a field configured by columnNameOfCorruptRecord, and sets malformed fields to null. To keep corrupt records, an user can set a string type field named columnNameOfCorruptRecord in an user-defined schema. If a schema does not have the field, it drops corrupt records during parsing. When inferring a schema, it implicitly adds a columnNameOfCorruptRecord field in an output schema. DROPMALFORMED: ignores the whole corrupted records. This mode is unsupported in the JSON built-in functions. FAILFAST: throws an exception when it meets corrupted records. | read       |

### Parquet
- This is an open-source column oriente data source
- Provides storage optimization for analytics workload
- Saves storage
- Allow reading individual columns
- Works great with spark
- Supports complext types
- Schema is build into parquet files

|---------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| mergeSchema   | false   | sets whether we should merge schemas collected from all ORC part-files. This will override spark.sql.orc.mergeSchema. The default value is specified in spark.sql.orc.mergeSchema.                                      | read  |
| compression   | snappy  | compression codec to use when saving to file. This can be one of the known case-insensitive shorten names (none, snappy, zlib, lzo, zstd and lz4). This will override orc.compress and spark.sql.orc.compression.codec. | write |


### Text Files
- For text files, each line becomes a record.

| lineSep       | \r, \r\n, \n (for reading), \n (for writing) | Defines the line separator that should be used for reading or writing.                                                                                  | read/write |

### Conclusion
In this post, I tried to include the read and write operations for core spark sources. I have not covered SQL as I am planning to use it and then create a blog post based on my learning. In the subsequent post, I will cover advanced I/O concepts for apache spark.
