Seeing a snow leopard in the wild was my dream from the day I saw BBC planet earth. At that time, I had no clue that I could also fulfill that dream. After hearing tons of snow leopard expedition stories, me and my friend Bhavya Joshi planned to visit spiti valley in Feb 2020. I will include more details in the upcoming blogs around planning, gears to take and overall challenges associated with the expedition. 

Here are a few pictures I clicked on that trip.
