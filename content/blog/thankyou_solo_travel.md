## Thank You All...
As I complete my 4 month trip to Himachal Pradesh, **I would like to thank all the wonderful people** I came across. The best part of the whole trip was the people. I was very fortunate to meet some of the finest travellers during my trip. I was lucky in a way as the friends that we made in the first couple of weeks, stayed with us for the rest of the trip. It sums up the kind of friendship we have developed over the course of almost 4 months. Ofcourse, there was a set of people who come and go but there was another set of people who I can proudly call **family**. There has been a lot of learnings which helped me grow personally and professinally. I know myself better and there is a lot more clarity around what I want. **Hopefully we'll keep planning trips together in future**. 

I wish you all the happiness in the world...cheers.
