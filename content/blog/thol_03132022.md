## A Morning at Thol Lake
I visited thol today. We reached after the sunrise, around 7:15 ish in the morning. Because of the Weekend, there were number of people at the lake. In terms of birding, there was not much. I was there for about 3 hours. The light was a bit harsh. I was able to capture a few shots at the water level. This blog post will have a few images captured today. I am using Canon 7D Mark II, Canon 100-400 MM.
